# Script2.py

This script is part of an assignment that I completed as part of a Software Applications module in my 3rd year of college. This was the project outline:

- Create a Python script that will use the use the data.gov.ie API to combine at least
three data sources (you can choose the data sources and file format). 
- Create a dashboard. 

1. Extract the data and merge the files.
2. Save the data in a suitable format.
3. Create a suitable data dashboard. The data dashboard should ideally be interactive.
